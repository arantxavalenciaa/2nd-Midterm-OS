# 2nd-Midterm-OS
1. Dockerfile 
To avoid the 'wget not found' error or similar issues, I decided to install it using the following command:

-> apt-get install wget

After getting the following error: 

-> Do you want to continue? [Y/n] Abort.

I added the -y flag to confirm the installation. 
-> apt-get -y install wget. 


Now that we have the .zip file  its time to unzip it.

-> unzip /tmp/godot.zip \ . 

Rename it 
-> mv Godot_v4.4-stable_linux.arm64 /usr/local/bin/godot \

and remove the zip. 

-> && rm /tmp/godot.zip

When trying to run my image, got the following error. 
rosetta error: failed to open elf at /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.

This error occurred because Iâ€™m working on a computer with ARM architecture, so I decided to create two images: one for ARM and another for x86.

I changed the download link for Godot to one that matched my architecture and rebuilt the image. Now that I have two Dockerfiles, when running the docker build command, I need to specify which file to use. To do that, I used the following command: 

-> docker build -f Dockerfile.ARM .

However, I encountered the following error:

-> ERROR: Unable to load fontconfig, system font support is disabled.

To fix this, I added fontconfig to the installation line. Now, the container runs correctly. 

 
2. Go Server and React 

First I created a Go server that could access a database following the official Go documentation:
https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/database-access

Decided to use a mysql database, modeling a mini figures store. Wrote a query to obtain the top ten most sold products depending on the year. 

SELECT productName, YEAR(o.orderDate) as year,COUNT(od.quantityOrdered) as quantity
FROM products p, orderdetails od, orders o
WHERE p.productCode = od.productCode AND
      od.orderNumber = o.orderNumber
GROUP BY p.productCode, year
HAVING (year = '2003')
ORDER BY year,quantity DESC
LIMIT 10

Then, I transformed my server into an API using the following documentation:
https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/web-service-gin

Created the react front using the following sources:
